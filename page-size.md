# Page size

A typical web page is made up of several files that may include HTML, CSS, Javascript, or image files, as well as other resources. The page size is made up of all the files that make up the page.

## Best practice

* Optimize images. To improve the speed of your website it is important to consider compressing or resizing images to the recommended size per file of 200 KB.
* Avoid unnecessary custom fonts.
* Minify resources.
* Employ Content Delivery Networks (CDN).

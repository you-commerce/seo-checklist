# Page title

A page or meta title is an HTML tag that defines the title of a page. 
This tag displays a page title in search engine results, at the top of a user's browser, and also when a page is bookmarked in a list of favorites. 
A concise, descriptive title tag that accurately reflects your page's topic is important for ranking well in search engines.

```
<head>
 <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
```

## Best practice

* Use a unique, descriptive title per page (65 characters) in target language.
* Use the page's keyword in the title tag.

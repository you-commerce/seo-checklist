# Font formats

It is important to keep as much website content in readable text format (instead of graphic images of desired fonts) for good SEO and to maintain good search engine rankings.

## Best practice

Use one of these main font formats: 
* TrueType Font (TTF, most common)
* Web Open Font Format (WOFF, specifically designed for use on webpages)
* WOFF2 (with improved compressing)
* Embedded OpenType (EOT, supported only by IE)

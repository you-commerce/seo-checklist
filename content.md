# Content
The content of your website is crucial for good SEO. It is important that your content is unique and relevant. If you have multiple pages with the same content (or if you have your content on other peopleâ€™s websites), you will run the risk of getting penalized by Google and your search rankings will suffer.

### Best practice
* Create meaningful and unique content.
* Use at least 300 words per page.

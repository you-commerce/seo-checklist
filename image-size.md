# Image size
Images often represent the largest part of downloaded bytes on a webpage and occupy a considerable part of the visible area. Therefore, image optimization can often save the largest amount of bytes and achieve significant performance improvements for a website.

## Best practice

* Use small images (< 200 KB) that load quickly. Check the best practice in the [Google Developers Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/image-optimization).
* Use PNG and JPEG compression tools such as https://tinypng.com/.

## Check

* Google lighthouse can identify issues with image sizes

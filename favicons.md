# Favicons

Your site should be using and correctly implementing a favicon. 
Favicons are small icons that appear in your browser's URL navigation bar. 
They are also saved next to your URL's title when your page is bookmarked. 
This helps brand your site and make it easy for users to navigate to your site among a list of bookmarks.

# No follow tags

For good search rankings, make sure to add the “nofollow” attribute to external links (links to websites that you don’t own). This instructs search engines not to follow those links.


Normal link:
```
<a href="http://example.com">Example Website</a>
```

Link with no follow tag:
```
<a href="http://example.com" rel="nofollow">Example Website</a>
```
